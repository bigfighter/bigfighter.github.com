This post is all about power and how not to waste it.

## The Problem

For our project, we want the microchip to be powered by batteries. The ATmega328P's operating voltage range is 1.8 to 5.5 V. That makes it tempting to power it directly with three AA batteries. One problem with that is that a battery's output voltage is not stable over it's lifetime. Another constraint is that later we also want to power a radio module, which has a much narrower input voltage range of 1.9 to 3.6 V.

## The Solution

Simply put, the solution is to use a [cheap](http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=d014v) DC to DC [buck converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_converter) and to power down the microchip for as long and as often as possible.

### Hardware

![D014V]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.assets }}/power_photo.jpg)

The buck converter has an input range of 4.5 to 7 V and provides 3.3 V output at a maximum of 800 mA.
The LED and resistor are in series between VOUT and the ground. We will desolder them to remove an unwanted light source and conserve a few more electrons.

Both input and output side are [decoupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor) with a 10uF bulk capacitor and a 100nF bypass capacitor in parallel. The actual conversion is done by an AMS1117 low dropout voltage regulator ([datasheet](http://www.advanced-monolithic.com/pdf/ds1117.pdf), 8 pages, 93 KB).

On a breadboard it would look like this:

With this setup, we get a steady supply of 3.3 V. It is the responsibility of the software to ensure that the microchip draws as little current from it as possible.

### Software

The key to saving power on the software side of things is the watchdog timer, as described in chapter 11.8 of the [datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet_Complete.pdf) (660 pages, 35 MB). It is a separate 128 kHz oscillator that can be set to trigger the Watchdog Timer Interrupt after 2<sup>11</sup>, 2<sup>12</sup>, ..., 2<sup>20</sup> clock cycles, i.e. after 16ms, 32ms, ..., 8,192ms.

With that in mind, we can write code that arms the watchdog timer and then puts the microchip to sleep, waiting to be woken up by the timer or another external interrupt (if enabled).

The actual power saving is implemented in `tools.cpp`. The code should contain enough comments to be self-explanatory to someone with C++ experience and the datasheet.

## Conclusion

I was hoping to conclude this post with measurements of the chip's power consumption in various modes of operation. Unfortunately, it turns out that my Ammeter is not nearly good enough for the job. It reports a current of 0 mA, even when the LED is lit up. Sorry.
